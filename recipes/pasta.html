  <h2>Delicious and Easy to make Orecchiette Pasta</h2>
  <p>This delicious orecchiette pasta recipe only has a handful of
    ingredients, is very cheap to make, and most importantly, only
    uses one pan or pot for the entire procedure. Every year when it's
    time to go back to school I get inundated with requests from
    students to post recipes that are super-easy, cost pennies, and
    require a bare minimum of kitchen equipment — this is one of them!
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>½ onion, diced</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>8 ounces spicy Italian sausages, casings removed</li>
    <li>3 ½ cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups orecchiette pasta, or more to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup roughly chopped arugula, or to taste</li>
    <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add onion with
      a pinch
      of salt; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent,
      about 5
      minutes. Stir in sausage and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Pour 1 1/2 cups chicken broth into sausage mixture and bring to a boil
      while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan
      with a wooden spoon. Add orecchiette pasta; cook and stir pasta in hot
      broth, adding remaining broth when liquid is absorbed, until pasta is
      cooked through and most of the broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes.</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>Stir arugula into sausage-pasta mixture until arugula wilts. Ladle pasta
      into bowls and sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>
  </ol>
