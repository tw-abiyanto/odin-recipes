    <p>This is the ultimate no-fuss comfort food. A delicious, one-pan,
      homemade
      dinner featuring seasoned ground beef patties, sauteed mushrooms with
      onions and a rich, pan gravy. "The mushroom and onion gravy is wonderful
      over mashed potatoes or rice," says Krystal Wetter. "The gravy is still
      good even without mushrooms."</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>⅓ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped onions</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, chopped onion, egg, salt, and black
        pepper in a large bowl until evenly mixed. Shape beef mixture into 4
        patties, about 3/4-inch thick.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>Fry patties in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on both
        sides, about 10 minutes. Add beef broth, onion, and mushrooms; bring to
        a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until patties are no
        longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. Transfer patties to
        a platter and keep warm.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>Bring onion mixture to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water in a small
        bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook and stir until onion gravy is
        thickened, about 1 minute. Pour over patties to serve.</p>
